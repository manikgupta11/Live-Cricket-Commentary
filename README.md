# Live Cricket Commentary

Python script that continously monitors the cricket score from Cricinfo, displays live score at regular intervals and plays respective audio file when 4/6 is hit or a wicket falls.

For example: If a four is scored, the script plays a commentary audio announcing a four has been hit.

## Execution Instructions:

```
python3 commentary.py
```

Then enter match id from the displayed list of live matches and the script will start monitoring.
